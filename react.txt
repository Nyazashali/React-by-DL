Increase Performance
Reusability - Components - Custom Tag HTML,  CSS & JSL - Navbar, Footer

Routing - SPA Single Page Application.
Existing component will be replaced with the another instead navigating to another page.
component is nothing but cuatom Tag.

A key advantage of React is that it only re-renders those parts of the page that have changed,
 avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements.

React - Displaying the user interfaces by rendering componenets.

///React-componenets

A React component is a self-contained piece of code that defines a specific part of a user interface.
React components define what gets displayed on the UI. They accept inputs called props and return React elements describing the UI. 
Types
##There are two types of components:
>Class components: These components must include the extends React.Component statement and a render() method that returns HTML. 
>Function components: These components can be written using less code, are easier to understand, and are preferred.

syntax: 

function componentName(props){
          variables
          anonymous functions..
          return (
            <div>

            </div>
          )
    };

    export default componentName; - Export function from current file to another file.

    import componentName from 'relativePathFile'; - Import file from another file to current file.

    <ComponentName/> - Componenet is nothing but custom tag

    componentName - should be Pascal case
