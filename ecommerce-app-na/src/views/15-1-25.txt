React Hooks:
1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useContext



> the process of passing data down through multiple layers of components in React.
 It's a common way to share data between components. 

> Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level

Why not to use prop drilling? 
>Code Complexity: As components grow, prop drilling increases code complexity as it is difficult to track the flow of data through various components. 
>Reduced Maintainability: It will become very challenging to maintain the code with prop drilling

Props Drilling is good for simpler apps or when you want clear data flow. Context API is better for big apps 
where you want to manage state across many components easily.

> To overcome props drilling, we use context API.
