Code splitting and lazy loading with React Suspence

#Code splitting - Code Splitting is a method that helps to generate bundles that are able to run dynamically. It also helps to make the code efficient.

Code splitting is the practice of splitting the code a web application depends on — including 
its own code and any third-party dependencies — into separate bundles that can be loaded independently of each other

#Lazy lodaing - used to initially load and render limited data on the webpage.
 It helps to optimize the performance of React applications. 
The data is only rendered when visited or scrolled it can be images, scripts, etc.

Syntax: 
 import { lazy, Suspence } from 'react';

 const ComponentName = lazy(() => import ('relativePathOfComponent'));

 <Suspence fallback={<div>Loading....</div>}>
 <ComponentName/>
 </Suspence>
